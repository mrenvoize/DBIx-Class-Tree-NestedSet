TODO

There are some issues about the current implementation that need consideration

    Is it possible to support multiple key indexes? Yes but we need to specify the root value when we create the root node
    Also search_related currently only works with single key PK
    In the event that a root column is not defined, should we default to using the primary key
        One reason why not, because we may want to add a new node as the new root or to add one tree to another
    Is the 'CASE' sql in NestedSet.pm compatible with all databases?
    What do we do if we have several objects (e.g. root) instances when we add new nodes. Do we 'discard_changes'?
    delete method seems to be ineficient for deleting a sub-tree
    I am not quite sure what 'has_descendent' should do.
